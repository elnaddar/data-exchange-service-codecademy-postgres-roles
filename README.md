# Data Exchange Service
This project will involve implementing a PostgreSQL database that’s suitable for storing data for a data sharing application. Imagine that your company has created a data platform that allows users to share datasets and the metadata (e.g. number of downloads, number of views, path to raw file).

A few select data publishers have been given access to your database and you’ve been tasked with setting up the permissions that allow these publishers to get relevant information about how users are interacting with the data they’ve uploaded.
